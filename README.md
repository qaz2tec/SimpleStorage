# SimpleStorage
This SimpleStorage project serves as a practical demonstration of how blockchain decentralized applications (dapps) operate.

Required Tools:

1. Node.js and npm should be installed on your system.
 
2. Install the Metamask extension in your browser, create a random account, and acquire some testnet Ethereum from the Sepolia faucet (https://sepoliafaucet.com/) to deploy the smart contract on the testnet.

Testnet: Sepolia
Faucet link: https://sepoliafaucet.com/

3. Obtain access to a node API link from Alchemy website (https://www.alchemy.com/) to facilitate your transactions.

4. A dapp consists of three key components:
 
Frontend
Backend - Smart contract
Connecting library - ether.js or web3.js
